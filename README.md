# MusicGameDesigner
Just for reference.
The song is a apaption of Firewalking by my roommate, and this project is noncommercial. Anyway, If there is any question with license, just let me know...
The video is to show how to use this application.
This is actually a level designer built for our music game demo(also noncommercial) as a homework project.
I refer to some blogs, but I write the codes by myself.
