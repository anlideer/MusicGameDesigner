# MusicGameDesigner
Just for reference.  
I don't use it for official use, it's just a homework of me. Anyway, if there is any question with license, just let me know...  
The video is to show how to use this application.  
This is actually a level designer built for our music game demo(also noncommercial) as a homework project.  
I refer to some blogs, but I write the codes by myself.  
See my music game in my project "MusicGameDemo".  

#Caution!!!
You have to make new directory D:\Dream, and your "myData.json" will be put in this dir.
